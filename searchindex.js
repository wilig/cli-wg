The commonly used log crate defines the following levels (ordered by increasing severity): trace debug info warning error It's a good idea to think of info as the default log level. Use it for, well, informative output. (Some applications that lean towards a more quiet output style might only show warnings and errors by default.)

In Rust, \"crashes\" are most often \"panics\" (i.e., \"controlled crashing\" in contrast to \"the operating system killed the process\"). By default, when a panic occurs, a \"panic handler\" will print some information to the console. For example, if you create a new binary project with cargo new --bin foo and replace the content of fn main with panic!(\"Hello World\") , you get this when you run your program: thread 'main' panicked at 'Hello, world!', src/main.rs:2:5\nnote: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace. This is useful information to you, the developer. (Surprise: the program crashed because of line 2 in your main.rs file). But for a user who doesn't even have access to the source code, this is not very valuable. In fact, it most likely is just confusing. That's why it's a good idea to add a custom panic handler, that provides a bit more end-user focussed output. One library that does just that is called human-panic . To add it to your CLI project, you import it and call the setup_panic!() macro at the beginning of your main function: use human_panic::setup_panic; fn main() { setup_panic!(); panic!(\"Hello world\")\n} This will now show a very friendly message, and tells the user what they can do: Well, this is embarrassing. foo had a problem and crashed.

Writing a program with a simple command line interface (CLI) is great a exercise for a beginner who is new to the language and wants to get a feel for it. There are many aspects to this topic, though, that often only reveal themselves later on.

Look at grrs foobar test.txt : There are two arguments, first the pattern (the string to look for), and then the path (the file to look in). What more can we say about them? Well, for a start, both are required. We haven't talked about any default values, so we expect our users to always provide two values. Further more, we can say a bit about their types: The pattern is expected to be a string, while the second argument is expect to be path to a file. In Rust, it is very common to structure programs around the data they deal with so this way of looking at CLI arguments fits very well. Let's start with this: #[derive(Debug)]\nstruct Cli { pattern: String, path: std::path::PathBuf,\n} This defines a new structure (a struct ) that has two fields to store data in: pattern , and path . Aside: PathBuf is like a String but for file system paths that works cross-platform. Now, we still need to get the actual arguments our program got into this form. One option would be manually parse the list of strings we get from the operating system and build the structure ourselves. It would looks something like this: let pattern = std::env::args().nth(1).expect(\"no pattern given\");\nlet path = std::env::args().nth(2).expect(\"no path given\");\nlet args = Cli { pattern: pattern, path: std::path::PathBuf::from(path),\n}; This works, but it's not very convenient.

If you call things like println! in a loop, it can easily become a bottleneck in an otherwise fast program. To speed this up, there's two things you can do. First, it helps to acquire a lock on stdout (or stderr ) and use writeln! to print to it directly. This prevents the system from locking an unlocking stdout over and over again. Second, you might want to reduce the number of writes you actually \"flush\" to the terminal. println! tells the system to write to the terminal every time, because it is usual to print each new line. If you don't need that, you can wrap your stdout handle in a BufWriter which by default buffers up to 8kB.

For example: let x = 42;\nprintln!(\"My lucky number is {}.\", x); will print My lucky number is 42. The curly braces ( {} ) in the string above is one of these placeholders. This is the default placeholder type that tries to print the given value in a human readable way. For numbers and strings this works very well, but not all types can do that.

That can take a lot of time. At the same time, many people have come to enjoy telling computers to do things for them. Let's talk about how to automate these tests. Rust has a built-in test framework, so let's start by writing a first test: #[test]\nfn check_answer_validity() { assert_eq!(answer(), 42);\n} You can put this snippet of code in pretty much any file and cargo test will find and run it. The key here is the #[test] attribute. It allows the build system to discover such functions and run them as tests, verifying that they don't panic. Exercise for the reader: Make this test work. You should end up with output like the following: running 1 test\ntest check_answer_validity ... ok test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out Now that we've seen how we can write tests, we still need to figure out what to test. As you've seen it's fairly easy to write assertions for functions. But a CLI application is often more than one function! Worse, it often deals with user input, reads files, and writes output.","breadcrumbs":"A command line app in 15 minutes » Automated testing","id":"tutorial/testing.html#automated-testing","title":"Automated testing"},"tutorial/testing.html#making-your-code-testable":{"body":"There are two complementary approaches to testing functionality: Testing the small units that you build your complete application from, these are called \"unit tests\". There is also testing the final application \"from the outside\" called \"black box tests\" or \"integration tests\". Let's begin with the first one. To figure out what we should test, let's see what our program features are. Mainly, grrs is supposed to print out the lines that match a given pattern. So, let's write unit tests for exactly this : We want to ensure that our most important piece of logic works, and we want to do it in a way that is not dependent on any of the setup code we have around it (that deals with CLI arguments, for example). Going back to our first implementation of grrs , we added this block of code to the main function: // ...\nfor line in content.lines() { if line.contains(&args.pattern) { println!(\"{}\", line); }\n} Sadly, this is not very easy to test. First off all, it's in the main function, so we can't easily call it. This is easily fixed by moving this piece of code into a function: fn find_matches(content: &str, pattern: &str) { for line in content.lines() { if line.contains(pattern) { println!(\"{}\", line); } }\n} Now we can call this function in our test, and see what its output is: #[test]\nfn find_a_match() { find_matches(\"lorem ipsum\\ndolor sit amet\", \"lorem\"); assert_eq!( // uhhhh Or… can we? Right now, find_matches prints directly to stdout , i.e., the terminal. We can't easily capture this in a test! This is a problem that often comes up when writing tests after the implementation: We have written a function that is firmly integrated in the context it is used in. Note: This is totally fine when writing small CLI applications. There's no need to make everything testable! It is important to think about which parts of your code you might want to write unit tests for, however. While we'll see that it's easy to change this function to be testable, this is not always the case. Alright, how can we make this testable? We'll need to capture the output somehow. Rust's standard library has some neat abstractions for dealing with I/O (input/output) and we'll make use of one called std::io::Write . This is a trait that abstract over things we can write to, which includes strings but also stdout . Note: We could also make this function return a String , but that would change the behavior. Instead of writing to the terminal directly, it would then collect everything into a string, and dump all the results in one go at the end. Let's change our function to also accept a parameter writer that implements Write . In our test, we can then supply a simple string to make assertions on. Instead of println!(…) we can just use writeln!(writer, …) . fn find_matches<W: Write>(content: &str, pattern: &str, writer: &mut W) { for line in content.lines() { if line.contains(pattern) { writeln!(writer, \"{}\", line); } }\n} Now we can test for the output: #[test]\nfn find_a_match() { let mut result = String::new(); find_matches(\"lorem ipsum\\ndolor sit amet\", \"lorem\", &mut result); assert_eq!(result, \"lorem ipsum\\n\");\n} To now use this in our application code, we have to change the call to find_matches in main by adding &mut std::io::stdout() as the third parameter. Exercise for the reader: writeln! returns an io::Result . Add error handling to find_matches . We've just seen how to be make it easily testable, we have identified one of the core pieces of our application, put it into its own function, and made it more flexible. Even though the goal was to make it testable, the result we ended up with is actually a very idiomatic and reusable piece of Rust code. That's awesome!","breadcrumbs":"A command line app in 15 minutes » Making your code testable","id":"tutorial/testing.html#making-your-code-testable","title":"Making your code testable"},"tutorial/testing.html#splitting-your-code-into-library-and-binary-targets":{"body":"There's one more step we can go here. So far we've put everything we wrote into the src/main.rs file. This means our current project produces a single binary. But we can also make our code available as a library, like this: Put the find_matches function into a new src/lib.rs . Add a pub in front of the fn (so it's pub fn find_matches ) to make it something that users of our library can access. Remove find_matches from src/main.rs , and instead add an extern crate grrs; on top. In the fn main , prepend the call to find_matches with grrs:: , so it's now grrs::find_matches(…) . This means it uses the function from the library we just wrote! The way Rust deals with projects is quite flexible and it's a good idea to think about what to put into the library part of your crate early on. You can for example think about writing a library for your application-specific logic first and then use it in your CLI just like any other library. Or, if your project has multiple binaries, you can put the common functionality into the library part of that crate. Note: Speaking of putting everything into a src/main.rs : If we can continue to do that, it'll become difficult to read. The module system can help you structure and organize your code.","breadcrumbs":"A command line app in 15 minutes » Splitting your code into library and binary targets","id":"tutorial/testing.html#splitting-your-code-into-library-and-binary-targets","title":"Splitting your code into library and binary targets"},"tutorial/testing.html#testing":{"body":"Over the decades of people doing software development one truth has been found: Untested software rarely works.

And when you feel ready to make a new release, go through the README and ensure that the behavior is still as expected. You can make this a more rigorous exercise by also writing down how your program should react to erroneous inputs. Here's another fancy idea: Write that README before you write the code.
